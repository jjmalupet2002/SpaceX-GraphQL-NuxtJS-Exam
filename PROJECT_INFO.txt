Project Description
-------------------
A high-performance, immersive web application that connects to the SpaceX GraphQL API to visualize mission data, rocket specifications, and launch history. Designed with a focus on modern web standards and user experience, this project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of real-time data integration and state management.
