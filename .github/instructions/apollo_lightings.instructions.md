- GraphQL integration with SpaceX API
- Pinia for state management
- TypeScript for type safety
- Deployment to Vercel

The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in setting up, extending, and optimizing a front-end project while following best practices, including commit hygiene and code readability.

## Requirement
- **Project Setup**: Clone/fork the starter repository, set it up, and ensure it runs correctly.
- **Launch Page**: Display a list of SpaceX launches including mission name, launch date, site name, rocket name, and details.
- **Filtering**: Filter launches by year using Nuxt composables.

- **Bonus Tasks**:
  - Implement Nuxt middleware for redirecting invalid routes
  - Add a creative feature to enhance UX
  - Integrate Pinia plugin for state persistence
  - Star and follow specified GitHub repositories
- **Submission**: Public GitHub repository link, Vercel deployment link, brief report of approach and challenges, and email submission.

## Boundaries
- Use only the specified technologies: Nuxt, Vue 3, Vuetify, GraphQL, Apollo, Pinia, TypeScript
- Stick to best practices in code readability, maintainability, and performance optimization
- Avoid external APIs outside SpaceX GraphQL API unless part of the creative feature
- Ensure the project is fully functional and deployable to Vercel
- Keep the GitHub repository public and commits descriptive following Conventional Commits
